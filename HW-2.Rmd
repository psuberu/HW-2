* What gave you the most trouble:Understanding the questions and what was expected for the Exploratry data analysis
* Any comments you have: 







## Question 1:

Question 4 on page 76 from Chapter 4 of Data Analysis Using Regression and
Multilevel/Hierarchical Models.  The codebook can be found
[here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.txt).
I've included R code blocks for each question, but use them only if you feel it
necessary.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
url <- "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.dta"
pollution <- read.dta(url) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```

### a)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=nox,y=mort,xlab=("NOX"), ylab=("Mortality Rate")))+geom_point(stat="identity")+geom_jitter(height = 0.2)
model1 <- lm(mort ~ nox, data=pollution)
model1
resid(model1)
A<- coefficients(model1)
plot1<- ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=nox,y=mort,xlab=("NOX"), ylab=("Mortality Rate")))+geom_point(stat="identity")+geom_jitter(height = 0.2)
plot1+ geom_abline(intercept=A[1], slope=A[2], col="blue", size=1)+geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1, level=0.95)
```
The regression is not a good fit nor does it accrately represent where the bulk of the data and can barely predict the trajectory of the data.A better line would have been one that was slightly positive.

### b)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=lognox))+geom_histogram()
pollution<-mutate(pollution,lognox = log(nox))
model2 <- lm(mort ~ lognox, data=pollution)
model2
resid(model2)
B<- coefficients(model2)
plot1<- ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=lognox,y=mort,xlab=("NOX"), ylab=("Mortality Rate")))+geom_point(stat="identity")+geom_jitter(height = 0.2)
plot1+ geom_abline(intercept=B[1], slope=B[2], col="blue", size=1)+geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1, level=0.95)

```
The regression is a much better fit than the previous regression line. Athough still not that great of a fit, it does accurately represent the trajectory of the data. 

### c)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
summary(model2)
```
In this model we see that a one unit increase in the logged nitric oxide 
levels leads to a 58.336 increase in the total mortality rate per 100,000 people. 

### d)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#plot3a<- ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=lognox))+geom_histogram()
pollution<-mutate(pollution,lognox = log(nox))
#plot3b<- ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=loghc))+geom_histogram()
pollution<-mutate(pollution,loghc = log(hc))
#plot3c<- ggplot(data=pollution,aes(x=logso2))+geom_histogram()
pollution<-mutate(pollution,logso2 = log(so2))
#plot3a
#plot3b
#plot3c
model3<- lm( mort ~ nox + so2 + hc, data=pollution)
summary(model3)
```


### e)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
pollutionCV<-pollution %>% 
mutate(Z_mort = (mort-mean(mort))/sd(mort))
ggplot(pollutionCV, aes(x=mort, y=(mort))) + 
geom_point()
model5 <- lm(Z_mort ~ mort, data=pollutionCV)
summary(model5)
```
Wasn't sure how to go about this.

### f) What do you think are the reasons for using cross-validation?



```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
Cross-validation tests the efficiency of a model by using a subset of the
available dataset to fit the model, then tests its ability to predict results using the rest of the dataset.
You would use cross validation to test how effectively a model can predict results of the rest of the data set. 




## Question 2:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the OkCupid data, keeping in mind 
in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to predict gender. What do I mean by
EDA?

* Visualizations
* Tables
* Numerical summaries

For the R Markdown to work, you must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from
Lec09 to the project directory `HW-2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% tbl_df()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Feel free to make multiple code blocks, but set echo, fig.width, fig.height as 
# above
smokes<- profiles %>% select(smokes, sex) %>% 
group_by(sex)%>% 
group_by(smokes, sex) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n))
smokes$smokes <- factor(smokes$smokes , levels = smokes$smokes [order(-smokes$n)])
ggplot(smokes, aes(x = smokes, y = n, fill = sex)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
labs(title = "Smoking Habits of Bay Area OK Cupid Users",
 x = "smokes", y = "Number of Users")
```
This shows the smoking habits of OK cupid users. Because there are a lot more males that visit the site, the number of men outnumber the number of women in all of the smoking categories. A better representation could have been showing the proportion, or the percentage of each gender that doesn't smoke, only smokes sometimes and is trying to quit e.t.c. This would make the stats more comparable between the males and the females. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Feel free to make multiple code blocks, but set echo, fig.width, fig.height as 
# above
drugs <- profiles %>% select(drugs, sex) %>% 
group_by(sex)%>%  
group_by(drugs, sex) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n))
drugs$drugs <- factor(drugs$drugs , levels = drugs$drugs [order(-drugs$n)])
ggplot(drugs, aes(x = drugs, y = n, fill = sex)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
labs(title = "Drug habits of Bay Area OK Cupid Users",
x = "Drug Use", y = "Number of Users")
```
This shows the drug habits of OK cupid users. Because there are a lot more males that visit the site, the number of men outnumber the number of women in all of the drug categories.A better representation could have been showing the proportion, or the percentage of each gender that never uses drugs, only uses drugs sometimes, or is trying to quit.This would make the stats more comparable between the males and the females.
